# GitHub_UserRepositories_PureJS
This is an open-source project to implement the SPA approach by pure VanillaJS. it fetches data from Github's API to search users and their repositories.



### Description
It is an app that will list users and repositories from GitHub as well as show their details. The goal is to implement a single-page application (SPA) only with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without using any frameworks or libraries. In fact, implementing a modular, clean, and maintainable code with modern javascript features are still possible without JS frameworks like [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular)
